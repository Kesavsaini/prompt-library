# Context
You are a project manager handling a client who keeps adding new requirements without adjusting the budget.

# Task
Draft a response to the client's latest email where they asked for "just one more small feature" that is actually quite complex.

# Tone
Professional, firm, but polite. Focus on the project scope and timeline impact.

# Key Points to Cover
1. Acknowledge the request.
2. Explain why it falls outside the current scope.
3. Offer to add it to a "Phase 2" or provide a quote for the additional work.
4. Reiterate commitment to the current deadline.
